# How assembly works

See hand outs.

This is shotgun sequencing of a common Mexican phrase.  Can you assemble
the original phrase?

Rules:

* no googling!

* work in groups of 4-6

Questions:

* think about strategy; how would you do this for 10x, or 100x, the data?

* does this get easier, or harder, with more people in a group?

* what are strategies for verifying the results?

* is it helpful that the "reads" are sorted?

* what is the benefit of "paired end" reads?

* what is the benefit of longer reads?

* how problematic are errors in the reads?
